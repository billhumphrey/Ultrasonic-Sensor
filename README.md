# Ultrasonic Distance Measurement with Arduino and LCD

This project demonstrates how to measure **distance using an ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04)** connected to an **Arduino** and display the results on a **16x2 LCD via I2C communication**.
Itâ€™s a great beginner-friendly project to understand how ultrasonic sensors work for distance detection.

##  How It Works

1. The **HC-SR04 sensor** emits an ultrasonic pulse through its **Trig pin**.
2. The pulse travels through the air, reflects off an object, and returns to the sensor.
3. The **Echo pin** receives the reflected pulse and measures the **time duration**.
4. Using the speed of sound, the Arduino calculates the **distance**.
5. The measured distance (in centimeters) is displayed on the **16x2 I2C LCD**.



##  Features

* Real-time **distance measurement**.
* **I2C LCD** for efficient display wiring.
* Simple and **low-cost** implementation.
* Great for projects like obstacle detection, parking sensors, or automation systems.

##  Troubleshooting

* **No reading on LCD:** Check I2C address (`0x27` or `0x3F`) â€” adjust in code.
* **Incorrect distance:** Ensure sensor faces a flat surface and avoid soft/absorbent materials.
* **No trigger response:** Verify TRIG and ECHO pin connections and 5V power supply.
